# 👋 Hi, I'm TheCompindium13

I'm a technical game developer with a focus on **Unity**, **gameplay systems**, **shader development**, and **AI programming**. I enjoy building modular, reusable systems and solving performance challenges in real-time environments.

Here are some of the projects I've contributed to:

---

## 🎮 Featured Projects

### 🍬 [Tricky Treats (Minor Production)](https://github.com/drew-aie/2024-MinorProduction-TrickyTreats)
_A Unity-based 3D game developed during a team production sprint._

- Contributed to gameplay mechanics and system architecture.
- Collaborated with designers and artists on rapid iteration.
- Focused on stability, modularity, and player experience.

---

### 🎨 [Unity Shaders Project](https://github.com/TheCompindium13/Unity-Shaders-Project)
_A sandbox project for building and testing custom shaders in Unity._

- Developed multiple real-time shaders using Shader Graph and HLSL.
- Includes underwater effects, distortion, foam layers, and post-processing.
- Focused on performance and stylized visuals for URP.
